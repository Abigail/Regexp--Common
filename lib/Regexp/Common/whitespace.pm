=head1 NAME

Regexp::Common::whitespace -- provides a regex for leading or
trailing whitescape

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Regexp::Common qw /whitespace/;

    while (<>) {
        s/$RE{ws}{crop}//g;           # Delete surrounding whitespace
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Please consult the manual of L<Regexp::Common> for a general description
of the works of this interface.

Do not use this module directly, but load it via I<Regexp::Common>.


=head2 C<$RE{ws}{crop}>

Returns a pattern that identifies leading or trailing whitespace.

For example:

        $str =~ s/$RE{ws}{crop}//g;     # Delete surrounding whitespace

The call:

        $RE{ws}{crop}->subs($str);

is optimized (but probably still slower than doing the s///g explicitly).

This pattern does not capture under C<-keep>.
