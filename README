==============================================================================
               Release of version 2013031301 of Regexp::Common
==============================================================================

The main reason for version 2.122 is a change in the license. You now
have the option to use this software under either the original Artistic
License, the Artistic License 2.0, the MIT license, or the BSD license.


WARNINGS:
       As of version 2013030901, $RE {balanced} is no longer supported 
       for pre-5.10 Perls.

       INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE in version 2.119:
       The $N settings for the -keep option of US postal codes
       ($RE {zip} {US} {-keep}) have been changed. See the 
       Regexp::Common::zip for details.

       INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE in version 2.113:
       Regexp::Common used to set $; to '='. This no longer happens,
       because setting $; breaks Filter::Simple. This means that regexps
       of the form $RE{foo}{"-flag=value"} no longer work!  They need
       to be written as $RE{foo}{"-flag$;value"} or as
       $RE{foo}{-flag => "value"}.

       When defining patterns using the pattern function, a = still
       needs to be used to separate the flag from its default value.
       This has not been changed.

       We are very sorry for the inconvenience.

NAME

    Regexp::Common - Provide commonly requested regular expressions


SYNOPSIS

     use Regexp::Common;

     while (<>) {
            /$RE{num}{real}/                
				and print q{a number\n};
            /$RE{quoted}/                   
				and print q{a ['"`] quoted string\n};
            /$RE{delimited}{-delim=>'/'}/   
				and print q{a /.../ sequence\n};
            /$RE{balanced}{-parens=>'()'}/  
				and print q{balanced parentheses\n};
            /$RE{profanity}/                
				and print q{a #*@%-ing word\n};
     }


DESCRIPTION

    By default, this module exports a single hash (`%RE') that stores or
    generates commonly needed regular expressions. Patterns currently
    provided include:

	* balanced parentheses and brackets
	* delimited text (with escapes)
	* integers and floating-point numbers in any base (up to 36)
	* comments in 44 languages
    	* offensive language
	* lists of any pattern
	* IPv4 addresses
        * URIs.
        * Zip codes.

    Future releases of the module will also provide patterns for the
    following:

        * email addresses 
        * HTML/XML tags
        * mail headers (including multiline ones),
        * more URIs
        * telephone numbers of various countries
        * currency (universal 3 letter format, Latin-1, currency names)
        * dates
        * binary formats (e.g. UUencoded, MIMEd)
        * Credit card numbers.


INSTALLATION
