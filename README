==============================================================================
                  Release of version 2.104 of Regexp::Common
==============================================================================

NOTE:  The jump to version 2.100 is there for no other reason than that
       CPAN.pm is stupid. The entire world considers version numbers to be
       dot separated *INTEGERS*, except CPAN, which considers them to
       be *FLOATS*. In which universe there can be more than one dot
       in a float is of course a mystery.

       CPAN.pm just couldn't deal with the fact one of the files in the
       distribution was of version 1.10, thinking the older 1.9 version
       was newer.

       It would be sooo tempting to start using Roman numerals as version
       numbers.

NOTE:  The jump from version 0.09 to 1.20 does not indicate a significant
       change in the API, or any other significant change. It's just that
       the version number now follows the revision number from CVS.

NAME

    Regexp::Common - Provide commonly requested regular expressions


SYNOPSIS

     use Regexp::Common;

     while (<>) {
            /$RE{num}{real}/                
				and print q{a number\n};
            /$RE{quoted}/                   
				and print q{a ['"`] quoted string\n};
            /$RE{delimited}{-delim=>'/'}/   
				and print q{a /.../ sequence\n};
            /$RE{balanced}{-parens=>'()'}/  
				and print q{balanced parentheses\n};
            /$RE{profanity}/                
				and print q{a #*@%-ing word\n};
     }


DESCRIPTION

    By default, this module exports a single hash (`%RE') that stores or
    generates commonly needed regular expressions. Patterns currently
    provided include:

	* balanced parentheses and brackets
	* delimited text (with escapes)
	* integers and floating-point numbers in any base (up to 36)
	* comments in 39 languages
    	* offensive language
	* lists of any pattern
	* IPv4 addresses
        * URIs.

    Future releases of the module will also provide patterns for the
    following:

        * email addresses 
        * HTML/XML tags
        * mail headers (including multiline ones),
        * more URIs
        * telephone numbers of various countries
        * currency (universal 3 letter format, Latin-1, currency names)
        * dates
        * binary formats (e.g. UUencoded, MIMEd)


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm files in their appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.
