NAME

    Regexp::Common - Provide commonly requested regular expressions


SYNOPSIS

     use Regexp::Common;

     while (<>) {
            /$RE{num}{real}/                
				and print q{a number\n};
            /$RE{quoted}/                   
				and print q{a ['"`] quoted string\n};
            /$RE{delimited}{-delim=>'/'}/

     }


DESCRIPTION

    By default, this module exports a single hash (`%RE') that stores or
    generates commonly needed regular expressions. Patterns currently
    provided include:

	* balanced parentheses and brackets
	* delimited text (with escapes)
	* integers and floating-point numbers in any base (up to 36)
	* comments in C, C++, Perl, and shell
    	* offensive language
	* lists of any pattern
	* IPv4 addresses

    Future releases of the module will also provide patterns for the
    following:

        * email addresses 
        * HTML/XML tags
        * mail headers (including multiline ones),
        * URLS (various genres)
        * telephone numbers of various countries
        * currency (universal 3 letter format, Latin-1, currency names)
        * dates
        * binary formats (e.g. UUencoded, MIMEd)


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.
