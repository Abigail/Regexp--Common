==============================================================================
                  Release of version 2.111 of Regexp::Common
==============================================================================

NOTE:  The jump to version 2.100 is there for no other reason than that
       CPAN.pm is stupid. The entire world considers version numbers to be
       dot separated *INTEGERS*, except CPAN, which considers them to
       be *FLOATS*. In which universe there can be more than one dot
       in a float is of course a mystery.

       CPAN.pm just couldn't deal with the fact one of the files in the
       distribution was of version 1.10, thinking the older 1.9 version
       was newer.

       It would be sooo tempting to start using Roman numerals as version
       numbers.

       Andreas points out that blaming CPAN isn't fair, that CPAN is just
       following Perls idea of Module version numbers: floats. So, in the
       rant, read 'Perl' where it says 'CPAN'.

NOTE:  The jump from version 0.09 to 1.20 does not indicate a significant
       change in the API, or any other significant change. It's just that
       the version number now follows the revision number from CVS.

NAME

    Regexp::Common - Provide commonly requested regular expressions


SYNOPSIS

     use Regexp::Common;

     while (<>) {
            /$RE{num}{real}/                
				and print q{a number\n};
            /$RE{quoted}/                   
				and print q{a ['"`] quoted string\n};
            /$RE{delimited}{-delim=>'/'}/   
				and print q{a /.../ sequence\n};
            /$RE{balanced}{-parens=>'()'}/  
				and print q{balanced parentheses\n};
            /$RE{profanity}/                
				and print q{a #*@%-ing word\n};
     }


DESCRIPTION

    By default, this module exports a single hash (`%RE') that stores or
    generates commonly needed regular expressions. Patterns currently
    provided include:

	* balanced parentheses and brackets
	* delimited text (with escapes)
	* integers and floating-point numbers in any base (up to 36)
	* comments in 44 languages
    	* offensive language
	* lists of any pattern
	* IPv4 addresses
        * URIs.
        * Zip codes.

    Future releases of the module will also provide patterns for the
    following:

        * email addresses 
        * HTML/XML tags
        * mail headers (including multiline ones),
        * more URIs
        * telephone numbers of various countries
        * currency (universal 3 letter format, Latin-1, currency names)
        * dates
        * binary formats (e.g. UUencoded, MIMEd)
        * Credit card numbers.


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm files in their appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.

    Alternatively, use the common approach:
        - untar the archive
        - run: perl Makefile.PL
        - run: make
        - run: make test
        - run: make install

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.111

Revision history for Perl extension Regexp::Common.

2.111 Wed Mar 12 23:30:03 2003
        - Introduced the -i switch. Important if you are using the functional
          interface and want to be able to match case insensitive.
          (Request from Tim Maher).
        - Introduced the -nospace switch for $RE{net}{domain}
          (Request from Juerd).
        - Decimal numbers.
        - WAIS URIs.
        - More generic setup to define comments for various languages.
        - Expanded and redid the documentation for comment.pm.
        - Comments for Advisor, Advsys, Alan, Algol 60, Algol 68, B,
          BASIC (mvEnterprise), Forth, Fortran (both fixed and free form),
          fvwm2, mutt, Oberon, 6 versions of Pascal,
          PEARL (one of the at least four...), PL/B, PL/I, slrn, Squeak.
        - 151114 tests in 42 files.
        - 125 patterns in 11 classes and 10 subclasses.

2.110 Fri Feb 21 15:58:14 2003
        - Fixed t/test_squares.t. '0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF' cannot be used
          on non-64bit platforms - eval to the rescue.
        - Added $VERSION to the .pm files who were missing them.
        - gopher, news, nntp URIs.
        - 145013 tests in 39 files.
        - 100 patterns in 11 classes and 9 subclasses.

2.109 Mon Feb 10 22:41:45 2003
        - Split out URI.pm into a myriad of files. There is a
          separate file for each URI scheme, and a separate file
          for each RFC that's used. URI.pm requires all the
          URI scheme files, and constructs the combining URI regexp.
        - file URIs.
        - Cut down on the number of tests run for certain classes.
        - 123810 tests in 36 files.
        - 95 patterns in 11 classes and 7 subclasses.

2.108 Sun Feb  9 22:58:56 2003
        - Postal codes for Belgium, Denmark and Greenland.
        - Renamed the postal code patterns.

        - 94 patterns in 11 classes.

2.107 Fri Feb  7 23:20:35 2003
        - telnet URIs; Lua and FPL comments.
        - common code factored out - created t/Common.pm
        - 175984 tests in 32 files.
        - 91 patterns in 11 classes.

2.106 Sun Feb  2 18:42:08 2003

          Palindromes, Dutch and US postal codes.
        - 131710 tests in 28 files.
          11 pattern classes.

1.20  Tue Aug 27 19:06:13 CEST 2002
        - Balanced patterns can now take multiple sets of arbitrary
          strings as delimiters.

        - Added tel URI regexes.

0.07  Mon Aug  5 14:31:17 CEST 2002
        - Fixed 'Regex::' and 'Rexexp::' typos.
        - Split t/test_uris.t into t/test_ftp_uri.t, t/test_http_uri.t
          and t/test_uris.t.

0.06  Mon Aug  5 00:56:19 CEST 2002
        - URI regexes. Currently only HTTP and FTP. More to come.

0.05  Thu Aug  1 12:01:04 CEST 2002
        - Improved the 'subs' method of MAC addresses.

0.04  Thu Aug  1 01:18:37 CEST 2002
        - Added the set of $RE{net}{MAC} regexes, by request of
          Iain Truskett <spoon@cpan.org>.
        - Required minimum Perl version for regexes for Haskell and
          Dylan comment, as they can be recursive.
        - Petdance suggested regexes for LOGO comments.

0.03  Wed Jul 31 15:21:11 CEST 2002
        - Made the entire setup more modular, giving each set of patterns
          its own .pm file. Loading all goes via Regexp::Common though.
        - use strict; everywhere - it also runs under -W (localized).
        - Added comment regexes for many more languages (26 currently).
