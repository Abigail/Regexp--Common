NAME

    Regexp::Common - Provide commonly requested regular expressions


SYNOPSIS

     use Regexp::Common;

     while (<>) {
            /$RE{num}{real}/                
				and print q{a number\n};
            /$RE{quoted}/                   
				and print q{a ['"`] quoted string\n};
            /$RE{delimited}{-delim=>'/'}/   
				and print q{a /.../ sequence\n};
            /$RE{balanced}{-parens=>'()'}/  
				and print q{balanced parentheses\n};
            /$RE{profanity}/                
				and print q{a #*@%-ing word\n};
     }


DESCRIPTION

    By default, this module exports a single hash (`%RE') that stores or
    generates commonly needed regular expressions. Patterns currently
    provided include:

	* balanced parentheses and brackets
	* delimited text (with escapes)
	* integers and floating-point numbers in any base (up to 36)
	* comments in C, C++, Perl, and shell
    	* offensive language
	* lists of any pattern
	* IPv4 addresses

    Future releases of the module will also provide patterns for the
    following:

        * email addresses 
        * HTML/XML tags
        * mail headers (including multiline ones),
        * URLS (various genres)
        * telephone numbers of various countries
        * currency (universal 3 letter format, Latin-1, currency names)
        * dates
        * binary formats (e.g. UUencoded, MIMEd)


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.02

Revision history for Perl extension Regexp::Common.

0.05  Thu Aug  1 12:01:04 CEST 2002
        - Improved the 'subs' method of MAC addresses.

0.04  Thu Aug  1 01:18:37 CEST 2002
        - Added the set of $RE{net}{MAC} regexes, by request of
          Iain Truskett <spoon@cpan.org>.
        - Required minimum Perl version for regexes for Haskell and
          Dylan comment, as they can be recursive.
        - Petdance suggested regexes for LOGO comments.

0.03  Wed Jul 31 15:21:11 CEST 2002
        - Made the entire setup more modular, giving each set of patterns
          its own .pm file. Loading all goes via Regexp::Common though.
        - use strict; everywhere - it also runs under -W (localized).
        - Added comment regexes for many more languages (26 currently).
        - Fixed some small bugs.
