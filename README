==============================================================================
                  Release of version 2.119 of Regexp::Common
==============================================================================

WARNINGS:
       INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE in version 2.119:
       The $N settings for the -keep option of US postal codes
       ($RE {zip} {US} {-keep}) have been changed. See the 
       Regexp::Common::zip for details.

       INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE in version 2.113:
       Regexp::Common used to set $; to '='. This no longer happens,
       because setting $; breaks Filter::Simple. This means that regexps
       of the form $RE{foo}{"-flag=value"} no longer work!  They need
       to be written as $RE{foo}{"-flag$;value"} or as
       $RE{foo}{-flag => "value"}.

       When defining patterns using the pattern function, a = still
       needs to be used to separate the flag from its default value.
       This has not been changed.

       We are very sorry for the inconvenience.

NAME

    Regexp::Common - Provide commonly requested regular expressions


SYNOPSIS

     use Regexp::Common;

     while (<>) {
            /$RE{num}{real}/                
				and print q{a number\n};
            /$RE{quoted}/                   
				and print q{a ['"`] quoted string\n};
            /$RE{delimited}{-delim=>'/'}/   
				and print q{a /.../ sequence\n};
            /$RE{balanced}{-parens=>'()'}/  
				and print q{balanced parentheses\n};
            /$RE{profanity}/                
				and print q{a #*@%-ing word\n};
     }


DESCRIPTION

    By default, this module exports a single hash (`%RE') that stores or
    generates commonly needed regular expressions. Patterns currently
    provided include:

	* balanced parentheses and brackets
	* delimited text (with escapes)
	* integers and floating-point numbers in any base (up to 36)
	* comments in 44 languages
    	* offensive language
	* lists of any pattern
	* IPv4 addresses
        * URIs.
        * Zip codes.

    Future releases of the module will also provide patterns for the
    following:

        * email addresses 
        * HTML/XML tags
        * mail headers (including multiline ones),
        * more URIs
        * telephone numbers of various countries
        * currency (universal 3 letter format, Latin-1, currency names)
        * dates
        * binary formats (e.g. UUencoded, MIMEd)
        * Credit card numbers.


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm files in their appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.

    Alternatively, use the common approach:
        - untar the archive
        - run: perl Makefile.PL

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.119

Revision history for Perl extension Regexp::Common.

2.119 Sat Jan  1 17:57:01 CET 2005
        - Changed -keep settings of $RE {zip} {US}.
        - Replaced occurrences of '\d' with '[0-9]' in number.pm and net.pm,
          because with Unicode more characters than just 0 - 9 will match '\d'.
        - Moved part of the tests of t/test_comment.t into different
          files in t/comment.
        - t/Common.pm now also tests OO and sub versions.
        - Fixed regex for J comments.
        - $VERSION nit in Regexp::Common::URI::RFC2384
        - POD nit in Regexp::Common::_support (Mike Castle)
        - POD nit in Regexp::Common::comment.
        - 176048 tests in 53 files.

2.118 Wed Dec 15 00:16:09 CET 2004
        - Introduced Regexp::Common::_support.
        - Disabled the '-prefix' option for Danish zip codes if the Perl
          version is older than 5.005_03, as they triggered bugs. 5.005_03
          and more recent versions of Perl don't have this problem.
        - Fixed the generic OO routines. (They never worked correctly).
        - 134191 tests in 49 files.

2.117 Thu Jul  1 12:11:47 CEST 2004
        - Fixed problems with squares and 32bit integer Perls.
        - Pod nits in Regexp::Common (Jim Cromie)
        - $VERSION fix in Regexp::Common::URI::RFCC2384 (Mike Arms)

        - 132238 tests in 48 files.

2.116 Wed Jun 30 11:37:45 CEST 2004
        - Restricted recognition of squares to numbers less than
          9000000000000000, to avoid problems with round-off errors.
        - Fixed an off-by-one error in t/zip/spain.t which caused some
          test to fail when they shouldn't.
        - 132235 tests in 48 files.

2.115 Wed Jun  9 23:59:13 2004
        - Patterns for comments of ABC, Caml, CLU, COBOL, ECMAScript,
          Icon, J, JavaScript, Lisp, M, MUMPS.
        - Patterns for postal codes of Norway, Italy and Spain.
        - Patterns for US SSN.
        - New way of doing tests using t::Common, giving more control
          to test program.
        - Random generators in t::Common.
        - Cut down on tests in test_lingua_palindrome.t.
        - Fixed bug in t/zip/australia.t could cause an infinite loop.
        - 132225 tests in 48 files.

2.114 Sun May 25 21:34:56 2003
        - Fix to t/zip/greenland.t to avoid generating valid zipcodes
          when testing for failures.
        - Fixes to t/URI/gopher.t and t/URI/wais.t to avoid warnings.
        - Australian postal codes now accept '0909'. (Ron Savage)
        - Added comments for 'C--', 'C#', 'Cg', 'Nickle', 'PL/SQL', 'QML'
          and SLIDE.
        - Fixed the assignment of the version number to $VERSION in 6 classes.
        - 158287 tests in 44 files.
        - 134 patterns in 11 classes and 12 subclasses.

2.113 Wed Apr  2 22:58:46 2003
        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!
          Regexp::Common used to set $; to '='. This no longer happens,
          because setting $; breaks Filter::Simple. (Report by Tim Maher).
          This means that regexps of the form $RE{foo}{"-flag=value"} no
          longer work! They need to be written as $RE{foo}{"-flag$;value"}
          or as $RE{foo}{-flag => "value"}.

          When defining patterns using the pattern function, a = still
          needs to be used to separate the flag from its default value.
          This has not been changed.

          We are very sorry for the inconvenience.
        - 157762 tests in 44 files.
        - 127 patterns in 11 classes and 12 subclasses.

2.112 Wed Mar 26 00:25:04 2003
        - prospero and pop URIs
        - Fixed documentation of Regexp::Common::lingua to document the
          lingua stuff instead of Regexp::Common::zip (Murat).
        - 157761 tests in 44 files.
        - 127 patterns in 11 classes and 12 subclasses.

2.111 Wed Mar 12 23:30:03 2003
        - Introduced the -i switch. Important if you are using the functional
          interface and want to be able to match case insensitive.
          (Request from Tim Maher).
        - Introduced the -nospace switch for $RE{net}{domain}
          (Request from Juerd).
        - Decimal numbers.
        - WAIS URIs.
        - More generic setup to define comments for various languages.
        - Expanded and redid the documentation for comment.pm.
        - Comments for Advisor, Advsys, Alan, Algol 60, Algol 68, B,
          BASIC (mvEnterprise), Forth, Fortran (both fixed and free form),
          fvwm2, mutt, Oberon, 6 versions of Pascal,
          PEARL (one of the at least four...), PL/B, PL/I, slrn, Squeak.
        - 151114 tests in 42 files.
        - 125 patterns in 11 classes and 10 subclasses.

2.110 Fri Feb 21 15:58:14 2003
        - Fixed t/test_squares.t. '0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF' cannot be used
          on non-64bit platforms - eval to the rescue.
        - Added $VERSION to the .pm files who were missing them.
        - gopher, news, nntp URIs.
        - 145013 tests in 39 files.
        - 100 patterns in 11 classes and 9 subclasses.

2.109 Mon Feb 10 22:41:45 2003
        - Split out URI.pm into a myriad of files. There is a
          separate file for each URI scheme, and a separate file
          for each RFC that's used. URI.pm requires all the
          URI scheme files, and constructs the combining URI regexp.
        - file URIs.
        - Cut down on the number of tests run for certain classes.
        - 123810 tests in 36 files.

        - telnet URIs; Lua and FPL comments.
        - common code factored out - created t/Common.pm
        - 175984 tests in 32 files.
        - 91 patterns in 11 classes.

        - Australian postal codes.
        - Reorganized t/ directory by adding subdirectories.
        - 88 patterns in 11 classes.

        - Forgot to add t/test_zip_german.t and t/test_zip_french.t
          to the MANIFEST file.

        - Added German and French postal codes.
        - Fixed some bugs concerning HTTP URIs.

        - Fixed a bug concerning HTTP and FTP URIs.
         (reported by Hermann-Marcus Behrens)

1.29  Thu Jan 16 12:07:02 2003
        - New since last release: Squares, Roman numbers, TV URIs,
          Palindromes, Dutch and US postal codes.
        - 131710 tests in 28 files.
          11 pattern classes.

1.20  Tue Aug 27 19:06:13 CEST 2002
        - Balanced patterns can now take multiple sets of arbitrary
          strings as delimiters.
        - Fax URIs.
        - More comment patterns.

0.09  Tue Aug  6 16:44:57 CEST 2002
        - Fixed $RE{URI}{tel}, local phone numbers can have
          future extensions as well.

0.08  Tue Aug  6 15:50:31 CEST 2002
        - Added tel URI regexes.

0.07  Mon Aug  5 14:31:17 CEST 2002
        - Fixed 'Regex::' and 'Rexexp::' typos.
        - Split t/test_uris.t into t/test_ftp_uri.t, t/test_http_uri.t
          and t/test_uris.t.

0.06  Mon Aug  5 00:56:19 CEST 2002
        - URI regexes. Currently only HTTP and FTP. More to come.

0.05  Thu Aug  1 12:01:04 CEST 2002
        - Improved the 'subs' method of MAC addresses.

0.04  Thu Aug  1 01:18:37 CEST 2002
        - Added the set of $RE{net}{MAC} regexes, by request of
          Iain Truskett <spoon@cpan.org>.
        - Required minimum Perl version for regexes for Haskell and
          Dylan comment, as they can be recursive.
        - Petdance suggested regexes for LOGO comments.

0.03  Wed Jul 31 15:21:11 CEST 2002
        - Made the entire setup more modular, giving each set of patterns
          its own .pm file. Loading all goes via Regexp::Common though.
        - use strict; everywhere - it also runs under -W (localized).
        - Added comment regexes for many more languages (26 currently).
        - Fixed some small bugs.
