Version 2013031101 Mon Mar 11 21:02:45 CET 2013
+ For integers and decimal numbers (reals), allow the user to specify the
  pattern of the signs (leading sign, and for reals, the sign of the exponent).
  This gives the user the option to ask for a pattern that matches unsigned
  numbers (by specifying the empty string as the pattern). 
  Requested by "Wilson, Jonathan" <jonathan.wilson@Vanderbilt.Edu>.

Version 2013030901 Sat Mar  9 14:51:42 CET 2013
+ Use (?-1) instead of (??{ }) for the recursive balanced pattern.
  This makes the pattern unavailable for pre-5.010 perls.

Version 2.113 Wed Apr  2 22:58:46 2003
+ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!
  Regexp::Common used to set $; to '='. This no longer happens, because
  setting $; breaks Filter::Simple. (Report by Tim Maher).
  This means that regexps of the form $RE{foo}{"-flag=value"} no longer work!
  They need to be written as $RE{foo}{"-flag$;value"} or as
  $RE{foo}{-flag => "value"}.

  When defining patterns using the pattern function, a = still needs to be
  used to separate the flag from its default value. This has not been changed.

  We are very sorry for the inconvenience.
+ 157762 tests in 44 files.
