0.09  Tue Aug  6 16:44:57 CEST 2002

        - Added tel URI regexes.

0.07  Mon Aug  5 14:31:17 CEST 2002

        - Added the set of $RE{net}{MAC} regexes, by request of
          Iain Truskett <spoon@cpan.org>.
        - Required minimum Perl version for regexes for Haskell and
          Dylan comment, as they can be recursive.

0.03  Wed Jul 31 15:21:11 CEST 2002
        - Made the entire setup more modular, giving each set of patterns
          its own .pm file. Loading all goes via Regexp::Common though.
        - use strict; everywhere - it also runs under -W (localized).
        - Added comment regexes for many more languages (25 currently).
        - Fixed some small bugs.
