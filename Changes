Version 2024080801 Thu Aug  8 19:06:47 CEST 2024
+ Eliminate 'use vars'.
+ Update the MySQL comment pattern.

Version 2017060201 Fri Jun  2 23:48:32 CEST 2017
+ Prepare for 5.26: don't rely on '.' being present in @INC when testing.

Version 2016060801 Wed Jun  8 14:40:04 CEST 2016
+ Removed the optional leading 0 from Australian postal codes -- use -lax
  to enable this feature.
+ Improved the patterns for Belgian, Danish, Greenlandic, Swiss, Italian,
  German, French, and Norwegian postal codes, only matching actual
  valid codes.
  This implies rewriting their tests from scratch.
+ Added patterns for postal codes for Liechtenstein, Luxembourg,
  Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City.
+ 2315992 tests in 73 files.

Version 2016060201 Thu Jun  2 02:58:35 CEST 2016
+ Improved Australian zip code pattern; pattern matches current zip codes

+ Stop distributing author tests.
+ 522126 tests in 68 files.

Version 2016060101 Wed Jun  1 00:34:17 CEST 2016
+ We ceased to support pre-5.10.0 perls.
+ Fix warnings for older perls ($RE {delimited})
+ Removed t/test_keep.t
+ Improved testing for square numbers.
+ Updated the Copyright notices to include the current year.
+ 481918 tests in 72 files.

Version 2016053101 Tue May 31 00:16:57 CEST 2016
+ Added a pattern for Austrian postal codes. (RT 53299)

Version 2016053001 Mon May 30 14:12:17 CEST 2016
+ No change at all, work around PAUSE issues.

Version 2016052901 Sun May 29 22:46:42 CEST 2016
+ Fix POD nit (RT 103850)
+ Don't run author only tests, unless AUTHOR_TESTING is set (RT 90600)
+ Added a 'strict' option to matching IPv4 addresses. (RT 93437)
+ 392978 tests in 71 files.

Version 2016052804 Sat May 28 23:24:37 CEST 2016
+ Fix issues with matching Roman numerals, where the pattern wasn't greedy
  enough. (RT 104353)
+ Allow Roman numerals to match sequences of 4 Is, Xs, Cs and Ms. This 
  raises the maximum number to be matched to 4999 (MMMMCMXCIX)
+ POD nits (Debian Perl Group)
+ 387994 tests in 67 files.

Version 2016052803 Sat May 28 12:24:06 CEST 2016
+ POD nits (Debian Perl Group)
+ Eliminate the use of s///r (Slaven Rezix)
+ Require 5.014 for the 'bquote' pattern.

Version 2016052802 Sat May 28 01:40:43 CEST 2016
+ Document what is captured for the 'bquote' pattern.

Version 2016052801 Sat May 28 00:40:22 CEST 2016
+ When multiple delimiters are given, wrap the clauses inside a (?|).
  This makes that, under -keep, the used delimiters are always in
  $2 and $4, and the string between the delimiters is always in $3.
  A requirement on 5.10.0 is now in place for the 'delimited' and 'quoted'
  patterns.
+ The 'delimited' pattern now allows specifying closing delimiters which
  are different from the opening delimiters.
+ Added a 'bquoted' pattern, which is a shortcut for using the 'delimited'
  pattern with 85 mirror imaged bracketing constructs.
+ 248427 tests in 67 files.

Version 2016020301 Wed Feb  3 20:00:13 CET 2016
+ Fixed POD issue (Hernan Lopes)

Version 2016010801 Fri Jan  8 12:52:36 CET 2016
+ Use 'done_testing ()' instead of 'done_testing', so the test file compiles
  even if the user uses an old Test::More.

Version 2016010701 Thu Jan  7 19:31:34 CET 2016
+ Removed the 29143 tests from t/number/integer.t, and replaced them with
  34689 spread over 7 new files. The reason is, there are sporadic failures
  reported by CPAN testers in the t/number/integer.t file, but this file
  uses the random number generator to generate tests. Which makes issues
  very hard to debug, as failures cannot be reproduced.

  The new tests will be deterministic.

Version 2015121601 Wed Dec 16 01:12:18 CET 2015
+ Force Darwin 10.0 on Perl 5.10.0 to run square tests in 32 bit mode.

+ Pattern for IPv6 addresses. Requested by Guy Edwards and many others.
  RT 50693.

Version 2013031201 Tue Mar 12 15:44:48 CET 2013
+ Allow host/domain names to start with a digit, using
  $RE{net}{domain}{-rfc1101}. Requested by Guy Edwards and many others.
  RT 23626.

Version 2013031101 Mon Mar 11 21:02:45 CET 2013
+ For integers and decimal numbers (reals), allow the user to specify the
  pattern of the signs (leading sign, and for reals, the sign of the exponent).
  This gives the user the option to ask for a pattern that matches unsigned
  numbers (by specifying the empty string as the pattern). 
  Requested by "Wilson, Jonathan" <jonathan.wilson@Vanderbilt.Edu>.

Version 2013030901 Sat Mar  9 14:51:42 CET 2013
+ Use (?-1) instead of (??{ }) for the recursive balanced pattern.
  This makes the pattern unavailable for pre-5.010 perls.

Version 2011121001 Sat Dec 10 21:32:49 CET 2011
+ Fixed a few cases where $[ was used instead of $].
  (RT 73033 by Father Chrysostomos <sprout@cpan.org>)
+ Typo fix in docs (P Ramakers <pramakers@gmail.com>)
+ Add an explicite 1 to end the main module; otherwise it may fail under Mason

  in RT ticket 2833.

+ Fix typo in repository (avar@cpan.org)

Version 2011041601 Sat Apr 16 16:07:29 CEST 2011
+ Fix bugs 61712 & 6940: $RE {num} {decimal} and $RE {num} {real} no longer
  match a single dot.

Version 2010010201 Sat Jan  2 17:45:53 CET 2010
+ Playing the CPANTS game
+ Adjustments for 5.005.

  now take arguments for the form 'N,M'.
+ New file: t/number/integer.t
+ Comments for BML, INTERCAL (JP), and CQL.
+ Regexp::Common::SEN nits.
+ Many more tests.
+ ca. 223k tests in 56 files.

Version 2.119 Sat Jan  1 17:57:01 CET 2005
+ Changed -keep settings of $RE {zip} {US}.
+ Replaced occurrences of '\d' with '[0-9]' in number.pm and net.pm,
  because with Unicode more characters than just 0 - 9 will match '\d'.
+ Moved part of the tests of t/test_comment.t into different
  files in t/comment.
+ t/Common.pm now also tests OO and sub versions.
+ Fixed regex for J comments.
+ $VERSION nit in Regexp::Common::URI::RFC2384

  version is older than 5.005_03, as they triggered bugs. 5.005_03
  and more recent versions of Perl don't have this problem.

Version 2.117 Thu Jul  1 12:11:47 CEST 2004

  9000000000000000, to avoid problems with round-off errors.
+ Fixed an off-by-one error in t/zip/spain.t which caused some
  test to fail when they shouldn't.
+ 132235 tests in 48 files.

Version 2.115 Wed Jun  9 23:59:13 2004
+ Patterns for comments of ABC, Caml, CLU, COBOL, ECMAScript,
  Icon, J, JavaScript, Lisp, M, MUMPS.

+ 158287 tests in 44 files.
+ 134 patterns in 11 classes and 12 subclasses.

Version 2.113 Wed Apr  2 22:58:46 2003
+ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!
  Regexp::Common used to set $; to '='. This no longer happens, because
  setting $; breaks Filter::Simple. (Report by Tim Maher).
  This means that regexps of the form $RE{foo}{"-flag=value"} no longer work!
  They need to be written as $RE{foo}{"-flag$;value"} or as
  $RE{foo}{-flag => "value"}.

  When defining patterns using the pattern function, a = still needs to be
  used to separate the flag from its default value. This has not been changed.

  We are very sorry for the inconvenience.
+ 157762 tests in 44 files.
+ 127 patterns in 11 classes and 12 subclasses.

Version 2.112 Wed Mar 26 00:25:04 2003
+ prospero and pop URIs
+ Fixed documentation of Regexp::Common::lingua to document the
  lingua stuff instead of Regexp::Common::zip (Murat).

+ 127 patterns in 11 classes and 12 subclasses.

Version 2.111 Wed Mar 12 23:30:03 2003
+ Introduced the -i switch. Important if you are using the functional
  interface and want to be able to match case insensitive.
  (Request from Tim Maher).
+ Introduced the -nospace switch for $RE{net}{domain} (Request from Juerd).
+ Decimal numbers.
+ WAIS URIs.
+ More generic setup to define comments for various languages.
+ Expanded and redid the documentation for comment.pm.
+ Comments for Advisor, Advsys, Alan, Algol 60, Algol 68, B,
  BASIC (mvEnterprise), Forth, Fortran (both fixed and free form),
  fvwm2, mutt, Oberon, 6 versions of Pascal,
  PEARL (one of the at least four...), PL/B, PL/I, slrn, Squeak.
+ 151114 tests in 42 files.
+ 125 patterns in 11 classes and 10 subclasses.

Version 2.110 Fri Feb 21 15:58:14 2003
+ Fixed t/test_squares.t. '0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF' cannot be used

+ gopher, news, nntp URIs.
+ 145013 tests in 39 files.
+ 100 patterns in 11 classes and 9 subclasses.

  the URI scheme files, and constructs the combining URI regexp.

+ Cut down on the number of tests run for certain classes.

+ Petdance suggested regexes for LOGO comments.
