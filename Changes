Revision history for Perl extension Regexp::Common.

0.05  Thu Aug  1 12:01:04 CEST 2002
        - Improved the 'subs' method of MAC addresses.

0.04  Thu Aug  1 01:18:37 CEST 2002
        - Added the set of $RE{net}{MAC} regexes, by request of
          Iain Truskett <spoon@cpan.org>.
        - Required minimum Perl version for regexes for Haskell and
          Dylan comment, as they can be recursive.

0.03  Wed Jul 31 15:21:11 CEST 2002
        - Made the entire setup more modular, giving each set of patterns
          its own .pm file. Loading all goes via Regexp::Common though.
        - use strict; everywhere - it also runs under -W (localized).
        - Added comment regexes for many more languages (25 currently).
        - Fixed some small bugs.

0.02  Tue Jul 23 23:18:15 2002
        - Added $RE{comment}{HTML}
